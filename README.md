    This is a machine learning assignment in which we use a ML model to predict risk of forest fire in Canada
using fire data from 2011 through 2015, as well as weather and tree genus data from the same period.

    In our findings, we found that the biggest predictor of wildfires were mean temperature and precipitation,
which led us to conclude that instances of wildfires will become increasingly more common as a direct result
of climate change.
